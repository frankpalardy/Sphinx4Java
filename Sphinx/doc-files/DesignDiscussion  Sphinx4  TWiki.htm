<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Avoid having too many separate input files. In a trainer, all inputs must 
  be matched and synchronized at some level. If there are too many inputs, the 
  possibility of error increases. Our experience with earlier trainers prompts 
  us to put this requirement at the top of our general guidelines list. 
  <LI>It must be possible to perform the entire training with one command, if 
  the user desires so. Otherwise, it must also be possible for an 
  <EM>expert</EM> user to intervene at various stages of training and control 
  the training at fine levels. 
  <LI>For default "one-command" operation, the system must intelligently select 
  appropriate values for parameters that may be data dependent (e.g. number of 
  tied states, number of Gaussians/state, thresholds, etc.), given the data size 
  and other top level configuration parameters, transcripts, dictionaries, etc. 
  <UL>
    <LI>The selection may be done through functions of these, if we can think of 
    any. If not whenever we write code and have to include some default numbers, 
    we must introduce several default values to select from if that is feasible. 
    </LI></UL>
  <LI>The trainer can run off raw data as well as features. The default will be 
  to run off raw data. </LI></UL>
<P>
<H2><A name=Control_File_format></A>Control File format </H2>
<P>The <EM>control</EM> file for the Sphinx4 will be a single XML file that 
contains all file identifier and transcript entries required for training. A 
proposed format may look like the following: <PRE>&lt;controlfile&gt;
  &lt;dict_default&gt;
    &lt;dict_unittype=1&gt;id_of the dictionary 1&lt;/dict_stream&gt;
    &lt;dict_unittype=1&gt;id_of the dictionary 2&lt;/dict_stream&gt;
  &lt;/dict_default&gt;
  &lt;utterance&gt;
    &lt;utt_id=34234&gt;   (COMMENT: the utt_id could be a path
                      to a file that in combination with
                      a &lt;cep dir&gt; read from the big
                      config file uniquely identifies
                      the utterance)
    &lt;exact=yes&gt;      (COMMENT: If exact is "yes", assume that the
                      transcript is already forced-aligned. Otherwise
                      the trainer must incoporate skippable silence
                      and consider alternate pronunciations when
                      building the sentenceHMM)
    &lt;unittype=1
        dict=XXX     (COMMENT: if you want to override default dictionary)
        trans = &lt;s&gt; &lt;sil&gt; SHE &lt;sil&gt; HAD(2) YOUR DARK &lt;sil&gt; SUIT &lt;/s&gt;
        ...          (COMMENT: Any other fields we may choose to add)
    &gt;
    &lt;unittype=2
        trans = &lt;s&gt; &lt;sil&gt; SHE &lt;sil&gt; HAD(2) YOUR DARK &lt;sil&gt; SUIT &lt;/s&gt;
         ...
    &gt;
  &lt;/utterance&gt;
.... MORE UTTERANCES...
&lt;/controlfile&gt;
</PRE>
<P>COMMENT: The "unittype" identifier refers to the type of sub-word unit. 
Different sub-word units will require different dictionaries. The dictionary 
used for any transcript will be the default dictionary for its unittype, unless 
an override dictionary has been specified. 
<P>Some restrictions: 
<UL>
  <LI>The "file-id" must be unique. No two files can have the same id. If 
  multiple files have the same name, the paths to the file must be included in 
  the id to make them unique. Given the file-id, one must be able to locate the 
  file (speech or feature file) uniquely in a corpus. 
  <LI>If multiple parallel "unittypes" are to be used for an utterance, (i.e. we 
  want to train multiple types of units, such as syllables and phones, 
  parallely), exact must always be "yes". Otherwise, proper sentenceHMM 
  construction becomes very difficult. </LI></UL>
<P>
<H2><A name=Dictionary_formats></A>Dictionary formats </H2>We will try to 
conform to VXML format, if any exists. If not, we will define our own XML format 
for the dictionary. 
<P>If we define our own format we will use the following guidelines: 
<UL>
  <LI>Word pronunciations will be in BNF format used for CFGs. Multiple BNF 
  pronunciations will be permitted. This covers all possibile ways of writing 
  pronunciations, including exhaustive listing (such as in the CMUdict). 
  <LI>Word pronunication probabilities will be permitted, both at the individual 
  pronunciation level, and within the BNF. Thus we can have two completely 
  different pronunciations with probabilities, and within one of these, we might 
  have minor phonetic variations within them. </LI></UL>e.g you might have QUININE 
0.4 K W AY N AY N, QUININE(2) 0.6 K W IH N {0.7 IY | 0.3 IH} N. 
<UL>
  <LI>Fillers can be marked as either "iscontext = yes" or "iscontext = no", 
  depending on whether we want to use them as acoustic contexts or not in 
  forming context dependent units for training. If they are not to be used as 
  context, the corresponding context in the sentenceHMM will be SILENCE, as in 
  the sphinx3 trainer. </LI></UL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A name=Training_with_multiple_unit_type></A>Training with multiple unit 
types </H2>The trainer should be able to take care of parallel unit types, for 
example, phonemes and syllables, tied at word boundaries. A simple way to 
visualize this is by creating a product HMM combining all possible states in the 
word and states in the syllable. Say, the word has 3 states and the syllable 2, 
this gives you 6 possible combo states. We can create a trellis of the product 
and Baum-Welch just works there. 
<P>The restriction we apply is that the transcripts for all unit types must be 
force aligned, so that the unit sequence for the sentence is unique for any 
single unit type. Otherwise, the sentenceHMM for any single unit type becomes a 
network. Tying the networks for two features at word boundaries becomes very 
difficult when context dependencies are considered. Since this will be a problem 
for CD training, and we want our current design to be easily extendable to CD 
training, we will avoid the complication by requiring forced aligned trancripts 
even for CI training. 
<P>If no forced aligned transcripts are available, you are better off training 
separately for these units. One may forced align with the individually trained 
models and perform joint training for further optimizing the models, if that 
seems necessary. 
<P>
<H2><A name=Training_with_multiple_features></A><A 
name=Training_with_multiple_features_></A>Training with multiple features. 
</H2>The trainer can train models for multiple feature types simultaneously. For 
example, one might simultaneously train an HMM for PLP and MFC models. Some 
natural questions arise: 
<UL>
  <LI>How does one distinguish between separate HMMs for multiple parallel 
  feature streams, and a single HMM for a multi-stream feature. If we trained 
  Sphinx-2 type models with separate distributions for cepstra, delta cepstra 
  and double delta cepstra, would we treat that as three separate HMMs tied at 
  state level, or a single HMM with a multi-stream feature? 
  <LI>How to integrate multiple HMMs, each with a multi-stream feature? </LI></UL>
<P>We have not definitively addressed these questions yet. However, our design 
should permit the most generic training, where we have multiple HMMs, each 
representing a different multi-stream feature. 
<P>Feature streams can be time synchronous, or time asynchronous. For example, 
we may want to train models simultaneously for MFC and PLP, both of which are 
computed at 100 frames/second. On the other hand, we may also want to train 
models simultaneously for speech and images, where the speech is parameterized 
at 100 cepstral vectors/second and the images arrive at 15 frames/second. The 
trellis structures for the two cases would be very different: 
<P>
<H3><A name=Time_synchronous_features></A>Time-synchronous features </H3>
<CENTER><BR><IMG src="DesignDiscussion  Sphinx4  TWiki_files/producthmm.gif"> 
</CENTER>
<P>The figure shows the effect of tying the HMMs for two different feature 
streams for a unit. The unit could be either a sub-word unit or a word. Feature1 
models the unit with a 3-state HMM. The state ids in the figure are "a", "b" and 
"c". Feature2 models the unit with a 2-state HMM. The state ids are "1" and "2". 
The two HMMs are tied at the ends of the unit. This implies that when the data 
for feature1 represents the unit, we constrain the data for feature2 to 
represent the unit as well. At each time instant, a pair of vectors are 
retrieved, one for feature1 and another for feature2. The vector for feature1 
could come from any of the three states, a, b or c. The vector for feature2 
could belong to any of the two states, 1 or 2. Hence, there are 6 possible state 
pair combinations, (1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c) that could have generated the pair 
of vectors. Each of these represents a compound state. A state (wx) can 
transition to state (yz) only if w can transition to y, and x can transition to 
z. If the HMMs for the two features have the same number of states, the HMMs 
could have been tied at state level as well. In this case, the combined HMM for 
this example would have only 3 states. In general, however, if the unit HMMs for 
features f1, f2, f2.. fK, are tied at the unit level, the combined HMM will have 
s1*s2*..sK states, where si is the no. of states in the HMM for the i-th feature 
fi. 
<P>The trellis used to train the HMMs for the two features jointly would be 
derived from the combined HMM, and would be as follows for the two-feature 
example above: 
<CENTER><BR><IMG height=294 
src="DesignDiscussion  Sphinx4  TWiki_files/producthmmtrellis.gif" width=712> 
</CENTER>The transition probabilities on the combined HMM (and therefore the 
combined trellis) are products of the transition probabilities in the HMMs for 
the individual features. e.g., T(1a -&gt; 2b) = T(1-&gt;2) * T(a-&gt;b). The 
state scores for any state in the trellis derived from the combined HMM is the 
product of the state probabilities of the individual states that compose it. For 
instance, at some time t, if feature1=f1 and feature2 = f2, the state 
probability of state 1a would be Pa(f1) * P1(f2) (where Pa() is the state output 
probability function of state a, P1() is the state output probability function 
of state 1). 
<P>Baum Welch can be performed as usual. 
<P>All states of the form 1* will contribute to the sufficient statistics of the 
state output distribution for state 1. All states of the form *a will contribute 
to state a. Similar logic will hold for the estimation of the transition 
probabilities as well. 
<H3><A name=Time_asynchronous_features></A>Time-asynchronous features </H3>
<P>When the two feature streams are asynchronous, the trellis becomes much more 
complicated. The figure below shows the tied HMMs for two features, where the 
data for feature1 (blue colored states) arrives at twice the framerate of 
feature2 (orange states). 
<CENTER><BR><IMG src="DesignDiscussion  Sphinx4  TWiki_files/AsyncHMM.gif"> 
</CENTER>The figure below shows the trellis that is derived from the above HMM. 
<CENTER><BR><IMG 
src="DesignDiscussion  Sphinx4  TWiki_files/AsyncHMMTrellis.gif"> </CENTER>The 
HMM on the vertical axis (to the left) has two kinds of arcs. The blue arcs 
represent transitions that can occur at instants when data vectors from feature1 
are available. In the example, since vectors from feature1 arrive at each time 
instant, these arcs are always active. The pink arcs show transitions that can 
occur only when vectors for feature2 are available. This is because the HMM can 
transit from states of type 1* to states of type 2* only when data from feature2 
arrive. The little dots below the time axis in the figure indicate the type of 
feature vector given at different instants. 
<P>The figure is clearly not a conventional HMM trellis. It is even debatable 
whether the combined HMM is an "HMM" in the strictest sense of the word, since 
there are multiple hidden Markov chains underlying the process. The markov 
chains switch, and the markov chain applicable at any time depends on the data 
vectors given at that instant. At any instant, the state output probabilities of 
a combined state is the product of the state output probabilities computed from 
all of its component states for which feature vectors are available. For 
instance, at time 2, the state output probability of state 1a is simply Pa(f1), 
whereas at time 3, it is Pa(f1)*P1(f2), where f1 is a feature1 vector, and f2 is 
a feature2 vector. 
<P>
<H3><A name=Generic_design_to_handle_both_ti></A>Generic design to handle both 
time-synchronous and time-asynchronous features </H3>
<P>The simplest way to manage multiple time-asynchronous inputs is the 
following: 
<OL>
  <LI>Determine the least common multiple, <EM>L</EM>, of the framerates of all 
  incoming features. 
  <LI>Attempt to retrieve data <EM>L</EM> times a second. Note that this does 
  not imply real-time processing. It merely means that we after processing all 
  data for a given time instant <EM>T</EM>, we then look for available data 
  vectors with the time stamp <EM>T</EM> + <EM>1/L</EM>. 
  <LI>At each instant, compose the transition matrix as the convolution of the 
  transition matrices of all individual features. However, use identity matrices 
  in lieu of the transition matrices for features that were not available at 
  that instant. 
  <LI>Transit according to the composed transition matrix. </LI></OL>
<P>Observe that this algorithm composes transition matrices dynamically. This is 
a distinctly different approach to that taken in the sentenceHMM used by the 
decoder. 
<P>
<H2><A name=Handling_forced_alignments></A>Handling forced alignments </H2>When 
forced-algined transcripts are available, the HMM for a sentence is easily 
constructed from it. For instance, if the utterance "THE DOG" has the faligned 
transcript "&lt;s&gt; &lt;sil&gt; THE(2) &lt;sil&gt; DOG &lt;/s&gt;", the 
sentenceHMM would simply be: 
<CENTER><BR><IMG 
src="DesignDiscussion  Sphinx4  TWiki_files/falignedsentence.gif"> 
</CENTER>However, it may not always be possible to provide forced aligned 
transcripts. While one solution would be treat raw transcripts as 
forced-aligned, train a simple model, forced align with it, and use those 
transcripts, a better option would be to simply include all possible alignments 
and pronunciations as alternatives, when constructing the sentenceHMM itself. 
For the example of "THE DOG", when we have two possible pronunciations for THE 
and only one for DOG, the un-forced-aligned sentenceHMM would be: 
<CENTER><BR><IMG 
src="DesignDiscussion  Sphinx4  TWiki_files/unfalignedsentence.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>Forced aligned transcripts are always much simpler to handle than unaligned 
transcripts, since the corresponding HMM is linear. For the unaligned 
transcripts, the treatment of context dependencies can become very difficult, 
especially for contexts greater than triphones, due to the presence of the self 
loop across the silence. To simplify, we will treat any number of passes through 
the silence as a single instance of silence, for the purposes of acoustic 
context (i.e., the pentaphone used for "TH" in both the following phoneme 
sequences, "AE N D &lt;sil&gt; TH AX &lt;sil&gt;" and "AE N D &lt;sil&gt; 
&lt;sil&gt; TH AX &lt;sil&gt;", will be TH((D,&lt;sil&gt;),(AX,&lt;sil&gt;))". 
<P>Context dependencies become far more difficult to handle in unaligned 
sentenceHMMs when merging sentenceHMMs from two models that use two different 
unit types. Hence, when the multiple models to be trained separately refer to 
more than one dictionary, we will expect the transcripts for each of the models 
to be faligned. 
<P>Some points about silence contexts: 
<UL>
  <LI>There are additional problems with longer contexts than triphones. This is 
  best illustrated with the following example. Consider the two phoneme 
  sequences "AX &lt;sil(5ms)&gt; DH EH N", and "AX &lt;sil(10sec)&gt; DH EH N". 
  The number within the parantheses beside the "sil" indicates the length of the 
  silence in each case. The two phoneme sequences differ only in the length of 
  the silence. The pentaphone for DH in both cases has the left context "AX 
  &lt;sil&gt;". However, it is clear that "AX" has absolutely no effect on the 
  pronunciation of "DH" in the second case, where the intervening silence is 10 
  seconds long. In fact, considering "AX" to be part of the left context in 
  these situations would be wrong, and including data from this instance of the 
  pentaphone when training the model for the pentaphone would actually affect 
  the model adversely. Attempting to distinguish between short and long silences 
  for purposes of context is not a good solution. We propose the following 
  simple solution: contexts are terminated at silences. Hence, here we would not 
  train a <EM>pentaphone</EM> for DH. Instead, we'd only permit the following 
  context dependent phone: "DH ((&lt;sil&gt;),(EH,N))". This is not a 
  pentaphone, since the left context is only a single phone. 
  <LI>In reality, intervocalic silences are acoustic events that can indeed be 
  part of contexts. Consider the compound word "New_York". One may pronounce it 
  with no pause between New and York, or one might say it with a pause. 
  Nevertheless, the W in New has an effect on the Y in York. Such intervocalic 
  pauses are quite frequent. We could represent such intervocalic pauses by a 
  new &lt;ivpause&gt; phone, which is different from &lt;sil&gt;. 
  &lt;ivpause&gt; could either be part of word pronunciations in the dictionary, 
  or explicitly marked in transcripts, where needed. Such pauses can be parts of 
  longer contexts. </LI></UL>
<H2><A name=Additional_notes></A>Additional notes </H2>Garbage Model: If 
multiple units, or multiple features are being trained simultaneously, either a 
garbage model is trained for each of them, or for none of them. We cannot train 
garbage models selectively for only some features or unit types. 
<P>Cache Directory: A cache directory could optionally be provided. If the 
trainer works from raw files, it can write out the features in the cache 
directory, if it is given. In later iterations, the trainer will look for the 
feature file in the cache directory, and recreate it from the raw speech data 
only if the feature file is not in cache, or if a cache directory has not been 
specified.

  <LI>Get transcripts from transcript file 
  <LI>If unfaligned transcript, convert to sentence HMM graph as above. 
  <LI>For each available unitHMMBuilder: 
  <OL>
    <LI>Poll unitHMMbuilder for dictionary id 
    <LI>Identify transcript with corresponding dictionary id. If no transcript 
    has the correct dictionary id, the unitHMMbuilder cannot be used for that 
    utterance. 
    <LI>For all words in transcript, obtain all phoneme pronunciations from 
    unitHMMbuilder 
    <LI>Construct a phoneme level graph 
    <LI>Determine largest context from unit HMM builder 
    <LI>For each phoneme in phoneme level graph, for each possible context (in 
    the case of unaligned transcripts), pass phoneme, along with the maximum 
    possible context, to the unitHMMbuilder. <EM>e.g.</EM>, if the 
    context-dependent model with the largest context is a pentaphone, pass the 
    phoneme, two preceding phones and two succeeding phones to the 
    unitHMMbuilder. The unitHMMbuilder will return the acoustic model for the 
    unit with the closest context to the one requested. <EM>e.g.</EM>, if the 
    sentenceHMMBulder requests a model for "DH((N,D),(EH,N))", but the 
    unitHMMbuilder has models only the triphone "DH(D,EH)" (due to data 
    insufficiency, or any other reason), it will return the model for the 
    triphone. 
    <LI>If the sentenceHMMbuilder asks for the pentaphone "DH((N,D),(EH,N))" and 
    obtains the triphone "DH(D,EH)" instead, it will, in future, not ask for 
    larger contexts than triphones for "DH(D,EH)". However, it may still ask for 
    pentaphones for "DH((AE,V),(EH,M))" (for example), since they may be 
    available for this newer context. 
    <LI>The sentenceHMMbuilder will expand the phoneme (or sub-word unit) level 
    graph to a full sentenceHMM with context-dependent models. </LI></OL>
  <LI>Once the sentenceHMMs for all the individual unitHMMbuilders are 
  constructed, they will be tied at the appropriate level (which may be 
  specified by the user). </LI></OL>
